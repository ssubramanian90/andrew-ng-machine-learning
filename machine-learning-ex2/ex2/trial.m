%% Machine Learning Online Class - Exercise 2: Logistic Regression
%
%  Instructions
%  ------------
% 
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the second part
%  of the exercise which covers regularization with logistic regression.
%
%  You will need to complete the following functions in this exericse:
%
%     sigmoid.m
%     costFunction.m
%     predict.m
%     costFunctionReg.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.

%% Load Data
%  The first two columns contains the X values and the third column
%  contains the label (y).

data = load('ex2data2.txt');
X = data(:, [1, 2]); y = data(:, 3);


plotData(X, y);

% Put some labels 
hold on;

% Labels and Legend
xlabel('Microchip Test 1')

%% =========== Part 1: Regularized Logistic Regression ============
%  In this part, you are given a dataset with data points that are not
%  linearly separable. However, you would still like to use logistic 
%  regression to classify the data points. 
%
%  To do so, you introduce more features to use -- in particular, you add
%  polynomial features to our data matrix (similar to polynomial
%  regression).
%

% Add Polynomial Features

% Note that mapFeature also adds a column of ones for us, so the intercept
% term is handled
X = mapFeature(X(:,1), X(:,2));


theta = zeros(size(X, 2), 1);


lambda = 1;

% Compute and display initial cost and gradient for regularized logistic
% regression
m = length(y); % number of training examples

% You need to return the following variables correctly 
J = 0;
grad = zeros(size(theta));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Compute the cost of a particular choice of theta.
%               You should set J to the cost.
%               Compute the partial derivatives and set grad to the partial
%               derivatives of the cost w.r.t. each parameter in theta

templog(:,1) = log(sigmoid(X*theta));
templog(:,2) = log(1-(sigmoid(X*theta)));
tempy(:,1) = y;
tempy(:,2) = 1-y;
temp = templog.*tempy;

% Formula for cost function. Note theta0 not involved in reglarization
J = (1/m)*(-sum(temp(:,1))-sum(temp(:,2))) + ...
    (lambda/(2*m))*sum(theta(2:end,1).^2);

% Compute gradient 
% theta0 not calclated with regularization
grad(1,1) = (1/m)*sum((sigmoid(X*theta)-y).*X(:,1)); 
grad(2:end,1)=((1/m)*((sigmoid(X*theta)-y)'*X(:,2:end)))'+(lambda/m)*theta(2:end);
